This is a UE5 project in PSX style
There is
- Affine Texture Mapping
- Vertex Snapping/Wobble (Customizable) 
- Pixelate (Customizable)
- Dhitering (Customizable) 
- Vertex Snapping/Wobble + Affine Texture Mapping 
To change textures, simply change them in the effects materials
Sorry for the level design
